The current team
================

These are the folks who have a long history of contributions, a solid track
record of being helpful on the mailing lists, and a proven desire to dedicate
serious time to Django. In return, they've been invited to join the :ref:`core
team <core-team>`.

`Luke Plant`_
    At University Luke studied physics and Materials Science and also
    met `Michael Meeks`_ who introduced him to Linux and Open Source,
    re-igniting an interest in programming.  Since then he has
    contributed to a number of Open Source projects and worked
    professionally as a developer.

    Luke has contributed many excellent improvements to Django,
    including database-level improvements, the CSRF middleware and
    many unit tests.

    communications software (industry) and crossword puzzle construction
    (freelance).  The last of these brought her to Django, in late 2006, when
    she set out to put a Web front-end on her crossword puzzle database.
    That done, she stuck around in the community answering questions, debugging
    problems, etc. -- because coding puzzles are as much fun as word puzzles.

    Karen lives in Apex, NC, USA.

    He enjoys contributing to the docs because they're awesome.

    Tim works as a software engineer and lives in Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Paul McMillan
    Paul found Django in 2008 while looking for a more
    structured approach to web programming. He stuck around after
    figuring out that the developers of Django had already invented
    many of the wheels he needed. His passion for breaking (and then
    fixing) things led to his current role working to maintain and
    improve the security of Django.

`Julien Phalip`_
    Julien has a background in software engineering and human-computer
    interaction. As a Web developer, he enjoys tinkering with the backend as
    much as designing and coding user interfaces. Julien discovered Django in
    2007 while doing his PhD in Computing Sciences. Since then he has
    contributed patches to various components of the framework, in particular
    the admin. Julien was a co-founder of the `Interaction Consortium`_. He
    now works at Odopod_, a digital agency based in San Francisco, CA, USA.

`Aymeric Augustin`_
    Aymeric is an engineer with a background in mathematics and computer
    science. He chose Django because he believes that software should be simple,
    explicit and tested. His perfectionist tendencies quickly led him to triage
    tickets and contribute patches.

    Aymeric has a pragmatic approach to software engineering, can't live without
    a continuous integration server, and likes proving that Django is a good
    choice for enterprise software.

`Claude Paroz`_
    Claude is a former teacher who fell in love with free software at the
    beginning of the 21st century. He's now working as freelancer in Web
    development in his native Switzerland. He has found in Django a perfect
    match for his needs of a stable, clean, documented and well-maintained Web
    framework.

    He's also helping the GNOME Translation Project as maintainer of the
    Django-based `l10n.gnome.org`_.

Jeremy Dunck
    Jeremy was rescued from corporate IT drudgery by Free Software and, in part,
    Django.  Many of Jeremy's interests center around access to information.

    Jeremy was the lead developer of Pegasus News, one of the first uses of
    Django outside World Online, and has since joined Votizen, a startup intent
    on reducing the influence of money in politics.

    He serves as DSF Secretary, organizes and helps organize sprints, cares
    about the health and equity of the Django community.  He has gone an
    embarrassingly long time without a working blog.

    Jeremy lives in Mountain View, CA, USA.

`Bryan Veloso`_
    Bryan found Django 0.96 through a fellow designer who was evangelizing
    its use. It was his first foray outside of the land that was PHP-based
    templating. Although he has only ever used Django for personal projects,
    it is the very reason he considers himself a designer/developer
    hybrid and is working to further design within the Django community.

    Bryan works as a designer at GitHub by day, and masquerades as a `vlogger`_
    and `shoutcaster`_ in the after-hours. Bryan lives in Los Angeles, CA, USA.

`Simon Charette`_
    Simon is a mathematics student who discovered Django while searching for a
    replacement framework to an in-house PHP entity. Since that faithful day
    Django has been a big part of his life. So far, he's been involved in some
    ORM and forms API fixes.

    Apart from contributing to multiple open source projects he spends most of
    his spare-time playing `Ultimate Frisbee`_ and working part-time
    at this awesome place called `Reptiletech`_.

Donald Stufft
    Donald found Python and Django in 2007 while trying to find a language,
    and web framework that he really enjoyed using after many years of PHP. He
    fell in love with the beauty of Python and the way Django made tasks simple
    and easy. His contributions to Django focus primarily on ensuring that it
    is and remains a secure web framework.

Baptiste Mispelon
    Baptiste discovered Django around the 1.2 version and promptly switched away
    from his homegrown PHP framework. He started getting more involved in the
    project after attending DjangoCon EU 2012, mostly by triaging tickets and
    submitting small patches.

    Baptiste currently lives in Budapest, Hungary and works for `M2BPO`_,
    a small French company providing services to architects.

Daniele Procida
    Daniele unexpectedly became a Django developer on 29th April 2009. Since
    then he has relied daily on Django's documentation, which has been a
    constant companion to him. More recently he has been able to contribute
    back to the project by helping improve the documentation itself.

    He is the author of `Arkestra`_ and `Don't be afraid to commit`_. He lives
    in Cardiff, Wales, and works for `Divio`_.

`Erik Romijn`_
    Erik started using Django in the days of 1.2. His largest contribution to Django was
    ``GenericIPAddressField``, and he has worked on all sorts of patches since.
    While developing with Django, he always keeps a little list of even the slightest
    Django frustrations, to tackle them at a later time and prevent other developers
    from having to deal with the same issues.

    Erik is an independent app maker, mostly developing web and mobile apps, as
    `Solid Links`_. He also enjoys helping ordinary developers to build safer web apps,
    for which Django is already a great start, and developed `Erik's Pony Checkup`_ with
    that goal in mind. Erik lives in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

    software developer and consultant.

    He discovered Django in 2008 shortly before the 1.0 release and has been
    hooked ever since. He contributes mostly to Django's ORM and Form
    components. His main contributions include advanced query prefetching,
    streamlining QuerySet and Manager to improve query reusability, and a
    significant refactor of forms error handling.

`Michael Manfre`_
    Michael started running Django on Windows against a Microsoft SQL Server
    (MSSQL) database in 2008. He quickly became the maintainer of the
    django-mssql 3rd party database backend. Much of his involvement with
    Django relates to the ORM, the private 3rd party database API, and using
    Django on Windows.

    Michael lives in Cary, NC, USA.

    .. _Michael Manfre: http://manfre.net

`Collin Anderson`_
    Collin found Django in November 2006. He was in awe of the admin and ORM
    and was amazed that the documentation was teaching him best web practices
    like redirecting after a successful POST request. Why had he never learned
    this before? No one knows to this day.

    He enjoys helping people on the |django-users| mailing list and making
    Django simple and easy for newcomers.

    Collin lives in South Bend, IN, USA where he uses Django to `increase
    unity`_.

`Josh Smeaton`_
    Josh was given the opportunity to work on a new Django app around version
    1.1 after working with a homegrown PHP reporting framework. The simplicity
    of the ORM and the power of the Admin were extremely liberating.

    Still being involved with custom reporting applications, he decided to try
    his hand at improving the ORM support for analytics. His contributions
    focus on giving more power to users of the ORM.

`Gabriel Hurley`_
    Gabriel has been working with Django since 2008, shortly after the 1.0
    release. Convinced by his business partner that Python and Django were the
    right direction for the company, he couldn't have been more happy with the
    decision. His contributions range across many areas in Django, but years of
    copy-editing and an eye for detail lead him to be particularly at home
    while working on Django's documentation.

    Gabriel works as a developer in the SF Bay Area, CA, USA.

    .. _gabriel hurley: http://strikeawe.com/

Malcolm Tredinnick
    Malcolm originally wanted to be a mathematician and somehow ended up a
    software developer. He contributed to many Open Source projects, served on
    the board of the GNOME foundation, and was a great chess player.

    Malcolm was deeply involved in many part of Django - most notably, the
    ORM, but many other internals bear his fingerprints. Django’s support for
    unicode and autoescaping in templates can both be almost entirely
    attributed to Malcolm.

    He was an International Man of Mystery and lived in Sydney, Australia.

    *Malcolm passed away on March 17, 2013.*

`Preston Holmes`_
    Preston is a recovering neuroscientist who originally discovered Django as
    part of a sweeping move to Python from a grab bag of half a dozen
    languages. He was drawn to Django's balance of practical batteries included
    philosophy, care and thought in code design, and strong open source
    community. Currently working in the rent-your-infra space (aka Cloud), he
    is always looking for opportunities to volunteer for community oriented
