Inventory
=========

.. contents:: Topics

Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the
same time.  It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in
Ansible's inventory file, which defaults to being saved in
the location /etc/ansible/hosts.

Not only is this inventory configurable, but you can also use
multiple inventory files at the same time (explained below) and also
pull inventory from dynamic or cloud sources, as described in :doc:`intro_dynamic_inventory`.

.. _inventoryformat:

Hosts and Groups
++++++++++++++++

The format for /etc/ansible/hosts is an INI-like format and looks like this::

    mail.example.com

    [webservers]
    foo.example.com
    bar.example.com

    [dbservers]
    one.example.com
    two.example.com
    three.example.com

The things in brackets are group names, which are used in classifying systems
and deciding what systems you are controlling at what times and for what purpose.

It is ok to put systems in more than one group, for instance a server could be both a webserver and a dbserver.
If you do, note that variables will come from all of the groups they are a member of, and variable precedence is detailed in a later chapter.

If you have hosts that run on non-standard SSH ports you can put the port number
after the hostname with a colon.  Ports listed in your SSH config file won't be used with the paramiko
connection but will be used with the openssh connection.

To make things explicit, it is suggested that you set them if things are not running on the default port::

    badwolf.example.com:5309

Suppose you have just static IPs and want to set up some aliases that live in your host file, or you are connecting through tunnels.  You can also describe hosts like this::

    jumper ansible_port=5555 ansible_host=192.168.1.50

In the above example, trying to ansible against the host alias "jumper" (which may not even be a real hostname) will contact 192.168.1.50 on port 5555.  Note that this is using a feature of the inventory file to define some special variables.  Generally speaking this is not the best
way to define variables that describe your system policy, but we'll share suggestions on doing this later.  We're just getting started.

Adding a lot of hosts?  If you have a lot of hosts following similar patterns you can do this rather than listing each hostname::


    [webservers]
    www[01:50].example.com

For numeric patterns, leading zeros can be included or removed, as desired. Ranges are inclusive.  You can also define alphabetic ranges::

    [databases]
    db-[a:f].example.com


.. include:: ../rst_common/ansible_ssh_changes_note.rst

You can also select the connection type and user on a per host basis:

::

   [targets]

   localhost              ansible_connection=local
   other1.example.com     ansible_connection=ssh        ansible_user=mpdehaan
   other2.example.com     ansible_connection=ssh        ansible_user=mdehaan

As mentioned above, setting these in the inventory file is only a shorthand, and we'll discuss how to store them in individual files
in the 'host_vars' directory a bit later on.

.. _host_variables:

Host Variables
++++++++++++++

As alluded to above, it is easy to assign variables to hosts that will be used later in playbooks::

   [atlanta]
   host1 http_port=80 maxRequestsPerChild=808
   host2 http_port=303 maxRequestsPerChild=909

.. _group_variables:

Group Variables
+++++++++++++++

Variables can also be applied to an entire group at once::

   [atlanta]
   host1
   host2

   [atlanta:vars]
   ntp_server=ntp.atlanta.example.com
   proxy=proxy.atlanta.example.com

.. _subgroups:

Groups of Groups, and Group Variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is also possible to make groups of groups using the ``:children`` suffix. Just like above, you can apply variables using ``:vars``::

   [atlanta]
   host1
   host2

   [raleigh]
   host2
   host3

   [southeast:children]
   atlanta
   raleigh

   [southeast:vars]
   some_server=foo.southeast.example.com
   halon_system_timeout=30
   self_destruct_countdown=60
   escape_pods=2

   [usa:children]
   southeast
   northeast
   southwest
   northwest

If you need to store lists or hash data, or prefer to keep host and group specific variables
separate from the inventory file, see the next section.

.. _splitting_out_vars:

Splitting Out Host and Group Specific Data
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The preferred practice in Ansible is actually not to store variables in the main inventory file.

In addition to storing variables directly in the INI file, host
and group variables can be stored in individual files relative to the
inventory file.

These variable files are in YAML format. Valid file extensions include '.yml', '.yaml', '.json',
or no file extension. See :doc:`YAMLSyntax` if you are new to YAML.

Assuming the inventory file path is::

    /etc/ansible/hosts

If the host is named 'foosball', and in groups 'raleigh' and 'webservers', variables
in YAML files at the following locations will be made available to the host::

    /etc/ansible/group_vars/raleigh # can optionally end in '.yml', '.yaml', or '.json'
    /etc/ansible/group_vars/webservers
    /etc/ansible/host_vars/foosball

For instance, suppose you have hosts grouped by datacenter, and each datacenter
uses some different servers.  The data in the groupfile '/etc/ansible/group_vars/raleigh' for
the 'raleigh' group might look like::

    ---
    ntp_server: acme.example.org
    database_server: storage.example.org

It is ok if these files do not exist, as this is an optional feature.

As an advanced use-case, you can create *directories* named after your groups or hosts, and
Ansible will read all the files in these directories. An example with the 'raleigh' group::

    /etc/ansible/group_vars/raleigh/db_settings
    /etc/ansible/group_vars/raleigh/cluster_settings

All hosts that are in the 'raleigh' group will have the variables defined in these files
available to them. This can be very useful to keep your variables organized when a single
file starts to be too big, or when you want to use :doc:`Ansible Vault<playbooks_vault>` on a part of a group's
variables. Note that this only works on Ansible 1.4 or later.

Tip: In Ansible 1.2 or later the group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories can exist in
the playbook directory OR the inventory directory. If both paths exist, variables in the playbook
directory will override variables set in the inventory directory.

Tip: Keeping your inventory file and variables in a git repo (or other version control)
is an excellent way to track changes to your inventory and host variables.

.. _behavioral_parameters:

List of Behavioral Inventory Parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As alluded to above, setting the following variables controls how ansible interacts with remote hosts.

Host connection:

ansible_connection
    Connection type to the host. This can be the name of any of ansible's connection plugins. SSH protocol types are ``smart``, ``ssh`` or ``paramiko``.  The default is smart. Non-SSH based types are described in the next section.


.. include:: ../rst_common/ansible_ssh_changes_note.rst

SSH connection:

ansible_host
    The name of the host to connect to, if different from the alias you wish to give to it.
ansible_port
    The ssh port number, if not 22
ansible_user
    The default ssh user name to use.
ansible_ssh_pass
    The ssh password to use (this is insecure, we strongly recommend using :option:`--ask-pass` or SSH keys)
ansible_ssh_private_key_file
    Private key file used by ssh.  Useful if using multiple keys and you don't want to use SSH agent.
ansible_ssh_common_args
    This setting is always appended to the default command line for :command:`sftp`, :command:`scp`,
    and :command:`ssh`. Useful to configure a ``ProxyCommand`` for a certain host (or
    group).
ansible_sftp_extra_args
    This setting is always appended to the default :command:`sftp` command line.
ansible_scp_extra_args
    This setting is always appended to the default :command:`scp` command line.
ansible_ssh_extra_args
    This setting is always appended to the default :command:`ssh` command line.
ansible_ssh_pipelining
    Determines whether or not to use SSH pipelining. This can override the ``pipelining`` setting in :file:`ansible.cfg`.

Privilege escalation (see :doc:`Ansible Privilege Escalation<become>` for further details):

ansible_become
    Equivalent to ``ansible_sudo`` or ``ansible_su``, allows to force privilege escalation
ansible_become_method
    Allows to set privilege escalation method
ansible_become_user
    Equivalent to ``ansible_sudo_user`` or ``ansible_su_user``, allows to set the user you become through privilege escalation
ansible_become_pass
    Equivalent to ``ansible_sudo_pass`` or ``ansible_su_pass``, allows you to set the privilege escalation password

Remote host environment parameters:

ansible_shell_type
    The shell type of the target system. You should not use this setting unless you have set the ``ansible_shell_executable`` to a non-Bourne (sh) compatible shell.
    By default commands are formatted using ``sh``-style syntax.
    Setting this to ``csh`` or ``fish`` will cause commands executed on target systems to follow those shell's syntax instead.
ansible_python_interpreter
    The target host python path. This is useful for systems with more
    than one Python or not located at :command:`/usr/bin/python` such as \*BSD, or where :command:`/usr/bin/python`
    is not a 2.X series Python.  We do not use the :command:`/usr/bin/env` mechanism as that requires the remote user's
    path to be set right and also assumes the :program:`python` executable is named python, where the executable might
    be named something like :program:`python2.6`.
ansible_*_interpreter
    Works for anything such as ruby or perl and works just like ``ansible_python_interpreter``.
    This replaces shebang of modules which will run on that host.

.. versionadded:: 2.1

ansible_shell_executable
    This sets the shell the ansible controller will use on the target machine,
    overrides ``executable`` in :file:`ansible.cfg` which defaults to
    :command:`/bin/sh`.  You should really only change it if is not possible
    to use :command:`/bin/sh` (i.e. :command:`/bin/sh` is not installed on the target
    machine or cannot be run from sudo.).

Examples from a host file::

  some_host         ansible_port=2222     ansible_user=manager
  aws_host          ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/example/.ssh/aws.pem
  freebsd_host      ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python
  ruby_module_host  ansible_ruby_interpreter=/usr/bin/ruby.1.9.3

Non-SSH connection types
++++++++++++++++++++++++

As stated in the previous section, Ansible is executing playbooks over SSH but is not limited to.
With the host specific parameter ``ansible_connection=<connector>`` the connection type can be changed.
Following non SSH based connectors are available:

**local**

This connector can be used to deploy the playbook to the control machine itself.

**docker**

This connector deploys the playbook directly into Docker containers using the local Docker client. Following parameters are processed by this connector:

ansible_host
    The name of the Docker container to connect to.
ansible_user
    The user name to operate within the container. The user must exist inside the container.
ansible_become
    If set to ``true`` the ``become_user`` will be used to operate within the container.
ansible_docker_extra_args
    Could be a string with any additional arguments understood by Docker, which are not command specific. This parameter is mainly used to configure a remote Docker daemon to use.

Here is an example of how to instantly deploy to created containers::

  - name: create jenkins container
    docker:
      name: my_jenkins
      image: jenkins

  - name: add container to inventory
    add_host:
      name: my_jenkins
      ansible_connection: docker
      ansible_docker_extra_args: "--tlsverify --tlscacert=/path/to/ca.pem --tlscert=/path/to/client-cert.pem --tlskey=/path/to/client-key.pem -H=tcp://myserver.net:4243"
      ansible_user: jenkins
    changed_when: false

  - name: create directory for ssh keys
    delegate_to: my_jenkins
    file:
      path: "/var/jenkins_home/.ssh/jupiter"
      state: directory
