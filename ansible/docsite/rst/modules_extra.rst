Extras Modules
--------------

These modules are currently shipped with Ansible, but might be shipped separately in the future. They are also mostly maintained by the community.
Non-core modules are still fully usable, but may receive slightly lower response rates for issues and pull requests.

Popular "extras" modules may be promoted to core modules over time.

This source for these modules is hosted on GitHub in the `ansible-modules-extras <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras>`_ repo.

If you believe you have found a bug in an extras module and are already running the latest stable or development version of Ansible,
first look in the `issue tracker at github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras>`_
to see if a bug has already been filed.  If not, we would be grateful if you would file one.

Should you have a question rather than a bug report, inquries are welcome on the `ansible-project google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project>`_
or on Ansible's "#ansible" channel, located on irc.freenode.net.
Development oriented topics should instead use the similar `ansible-devel google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel>`_.

Documentation updates for this module can also be edited directly in the module and by submitting a pull request to the module source code, just look for the "DOCUMENTATION" block in the source tree.

For help in developing on modules, should you be so inclined, please read :doc:`community`, :doc:`developing_test_pr` and :doc:`developing_modules`.
