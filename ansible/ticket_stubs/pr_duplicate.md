Possible Duplicated Efforts
===========================

Hi!

Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us that you've taken time to contribute.

It looks like the work from this pull request is a duplicate of the following PR(s):

   * INSERT PR(S) HERE

Based on this, we are going to close this PR in favor of the above.

However, we're absolutely always up for discussion.  Since this is a really busy project, we don't always see comments on closed tickets, but want to encourage open dialog.  You can stop by the development list, and we'd be glad to talk about it - and we might even be persuaded otherwise!

In the future, sometimes starting a discussion on the development list prior to implementing a feature can make getting things included a little easier, but it's not always necessary.

Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!
