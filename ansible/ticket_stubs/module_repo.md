Module Repo Information
=======================

Hi!

Thanks very much for your interest in Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 

This appears to be a submission about a module, and aside from action_plugins, if you know what those are, the modules
in ansible are now moved to separate repos.  We would appreciate if you can submit this there instead.

If this is about a new module, submit pull requests or ideas to:

   * https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras

If this is about an existing module:

   * Find the module at http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_all_modules.html
   * Open the documentation page for that module
   * If the bottom of the docs say "This is an extras module", submit your ticket to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
   * Otherwise, submit your module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core

Additionally, should you need more help with this, you can ask questions on:

   * IRC: #ansible on irc.freenode.net   
   * mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project

Thanks!
