Can You Help Us Out?
====================

Thanks for filing a ticket!

It looks like you might not have filled out the issue description based on our standard issue template.  You might not have known about that, and that's ok too, we'll tell you how to do it.

We have a standard template because Ansible is a really busy project and it helps to have some standard information in each ticket, and GitHub doesn't yet provide a standard facility to do this like some other bug trackers.  We hope you understand as this is really valuable to us!.

Solving this is simple: please use the issue template provided when you open a new issue. That's it!

If You Had A Question To Ask Instead
====================================

If you happened to have a "how do I do this in Ansible" type of question, that's probably more of a user-list question than a bug report, and you should probably ask this question on the project mailing list instead.

However, if you think you have a bug, the report is the way to go!  We definitely want all the bugs filed :)  Just trying to help!

Mailing Lists
=============

If you have concerns or questions, you're welcome to stop by the ansible-project or ansible-development mailing lists, as appropriate.  Here are the links:

  * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project - for discussion of bugs and how-to type questions
  * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel - for discussion on how to implement a code change, or feature brainstorming among developers

Thanks again for the interest in Ansible!
