Ansible Changes By Release
==========================

## 2.2 TBD - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

###Major Changes:

* Added the `listen` feature for modules. This feature allows tasks to more easily notify multiple handlers, as well as making it easier for handlers from decoupled roles to be notified.
* Added support for binary modules
* The service module has been changed to use system specific modules if they exist and fallback to the old service module if they cannot be found or detected.
* Several Windows facts were modified or renamed for consistency with their Unix counterparts, and many new facts were added. If your playbooks rely on any of the following keys, please ensure they are using the correct key names and/or values:
  - ansible_date_time.date (changed to use yyyy-mm-dd format instead of default system-locale format)
  - ansible_date_time.iso8601 (changed to UTC instead of local time)
  - ansible_distribution (now uses OS caption string, e.g.: "Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard", version is still available on ansible_distribution_version)
  - ansible_totalmem (renamed to ansible_memtotal_mb, units changed to MB instead of bytes)

## 2.1 "The Song Remains the Same" - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

###Major Changes:

* Official support for the networking modules, originally available in 2.0 as a tech preview.
* Refactored and expanded support for Docker with new modules and many improvements to existing modules, as well as a new Kubernetes module.
* Added new modules for Azure (see below for the full list)
* Added the ability to specify includes as "static" (either through a configuration option or on a per-include basis). When includes are static,
  they are loaded at compile time and cannot contain dynamic features like loops.
* Added a new strategy `debug`, which allows per-task debugging of playbooks.
* Added a new option for tasks: `loop_control`. This currently only supports one option - `loop_var`, which allows a different loop variable from `item` to be used.
* Added the ability to filter facts returned by the fact gathering setup step using the `gather_subset` option on the play or in the ansible.cfg configuration file.
  See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#gathering for details on the format of the option.
* Added the ability to send per-item callbacks, rather than a batch update (this more closely resembles the behavior of Ansible 1.x).
* Added facility for modules to send back 'diff' for display when ansible is called with --diff, updated several modules to return this info
* Added ansible-console tool, a REPL shell that allows running adhoc tasks against a chosen inventory (based on  https://github.com/dominis/ansible-shell)
* Added two new variables, which are set when the `rescue` portion of a `block` is started:
  - `ansible_failed_task`, which contains the serialized version of the failed task.
  - `ansible_failed_result`, which contains the result of the failed task.
* New meta action, `meta: clear_host_errors` which will clear any hosts which were marked as failed (but not unreachable hosts).
* New meta action, `meta: clear_facts` which will remove existing facts for the current host from current memory and facts cache.
* copy module can now transparently use a vaulted file as source, if vault passwords were provided it will decrypt and copy on the fly.
* The way new-style python modules (which include all of the non-windows modules shipped with Ansible) are assembled before execution on the remote machine has been changed. The new way stays closer to how python imports modules which will make it easier to write modules which rely heavily on shared code.
* Reduce the situations in which a module can end up as world readable.  For details, see: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/become.html#becoming-an-unprivileged-user
* Re-implemented the retry file feature, which had been left out of 2.0 (fix was backported to 2.0.1 originally).
* Improved winrm argument validation and feature sniffing (for upcoming pywinrm NTLM support).
* Improved winrm error handling: basic parsing of stderr from CLIXML stream.

* actionable (only shows changed and failed)
* slack
* json

####New Tests:

####New Inventory scripts:
* brook
* rackhd
* azure_rm

###Minor Changes:

* Added support for pipelining mode to more connection plugins, which helps prevent
  module data from being written to disk.
* Added a new '!unsafe' YAML decorator, which can be used in playbooks to ensure a
  string is not templated. For example: `foo: !unsafe "Don't template {{me}}"`.
* Callbacks now have access to the options with which the CLI was called
* Debug now has verbosity option to control when to display by matching number of -v in command line
* Modules now get verbosity, diff and other flags as passed to ansible
* Mount facts now also show 'network mounts' that use the pattern `<host>:/<mount>`
* Plugins are now sorted before loading.  This means, for instance, if you want
  two custom callback plugins to run in a certain order you can name them
  10-first-callback.py and 20-second-callback.py.
* Added (alpha) Centirfy's dzdo as another become meethod (privilege escalation)

###Deprecations:

* Deprecated the use of "bare" variables in loops (ie. `with_items: foo`, where `foo` is a variable).
  The full jinja2 variable syntax of `{{foo}}` should always be used instead. This warning will be removed
  completely in 2.3, after which time it will be an error.

## 2.0.2 "Over the Hills and Far Away"

* Backport of the 2.1 feature to ensure per-item callbacks are sent as they occur,
  rather than all at once at the end of the task.
* Fixed bugs related to the iteration of tasks when certain combinations of roles,
  blocks, and includes were used, especially when handling errors in rescue/always
  portions of blocks.
* Fixed handling of redirects in our helper code, and ported the uri module to use
  this helper code. This removes the httplib dependency for this module while fixing
  some bugs related to redirects and SSL certs.
* Fixed some bugs related to the incorrect creation of extra temp directories for
  uploading files, which were not cleaned up properly.
* Improved error reporting in certain situations, to provide more information such as
  the playbook file/line.
* Fixed a bug related to the variable precedence of role parameters, especially when
  a role may be used both as a dependency of a role and directly by itself within the
  same play.
* Fixed some bugs in the 2.0 implementation of do/until.
* Fixed some bugs related to run_once:
  - Ensure that all hosts are marked as failed if a task marked as run_once fails.
  - Show a warning when using the free strategy when a run_once task is encountered, as
    there is no way for the free strategy to guarantee the task is not run more than once.
* Fixed a bug where the assemble module was not honoring check mode in some situations.
* Fixed a bug related to delegate_to, where we were incorrectly using variables from
  the inventory host rather than the delegated-to host.
* The 'package' meta-module now properly squashes items down to a single execution (as the
  apt/yum/other package modules do).
* Fixed a bug related to the ansible-galaxy CLI command dealing with paged results from
  the Galaxy server.
* Pipelining support is now available for the local and jail connection plugins, which is
  useful for users who do not wish to have temp files/directories created when running
  tasks with these connection types.
* Improvements in support for additional shell types.
* Improvements in the code which is used to calculate checksums for remote files.
* Some speed ups and bug fixes related to the variable merging code.
* Workaround bug in python subprocess on El Capitan that was making vault fail
  when attempting to encrypt a file
* Fix lxc_container module having predictable temp file names and setting file
  permissions on the temporary file too leniently on a temporary file that was
  executed as a script.  Addresses CVE-2016-3096
* Fix a bug in the uri module where setting headers via module params that
  start with HEADER_ were causing a traceback.
* Fix bug in the free strategy that was causing it to synchronize its workers
  after every task (making it a lot more like linear than it should have been).

## 2.0.1 "Over the Hills and Far Away"

* Fixes a major compatibility break in the synchronize module shipped with
  2.0.0.x.  That version of synchronize ran sudo on the controller prior to
  running rsync.  In 1.9.x and previous, sudo was run on the host that rsync
  connected to.  2.0.1 restores the 1.9.x behaviour.
* Additionally, several other problems with where synchronize chose to run when
  combined with delegate_to were fixed.  In particular, if a playbook targetted
  localhost and then delegated_to a remote host the prior behavior (in 1.9.x
  and 2.0.0.x) was to copy files between the src and destination directories on
  the delegated host.  This has now been fixed to copy between localhost and
  the delegated host.
* Fix a regression where synchronize was unable to deal with unicode paths.
* Fix a regression where synchronize deals with inventory hosts that use
  localhost but with an alternate port.
* Fixes a regression where the retry files feature was not implemented.
* Fixes a regression where the any_errors_fatal option was implemented in 2.0
  incorrectly, and also adds a feature where any_errors_fatal can be set at
  the block level.
* Fix tracebacks when playbooks or ansible itself were located in directories
  with unicode characters.
* Fix bug when sending unicode characters to an external pager for display.
* Fix a bug with squashing loops for special modules (mostly package managers).
  The optimization was squashing when the loop did not apply to the selection
  of packages.  This has now been fixed.
* Temp files created when using vault are now "shredded" using the unix shred
  program which overwrites the file with random data.
* Some fixes to cloudstack modules for case sensitivity
* Fix non-newstyle modules (non-python modules and old-style modules) to
  disabled pipelining.
* Fix fetch module failing even if fail_on_missing is set to False
* Fix for cornercase when local connections, sudo, and raw were used together.
* Fix dnf module to remove dependent packages when state=absent is specified.
  This was a feature of the 1.9.x version that was left out by mistake when the
  module was rewritten for 2.0.
* Fix bugs with non-english locales in yum, git, and apt modules
* Fix a bug with the dnf module where state=latest could only upgrade, not install.
* Fix to make implicit fact gathering task correctly inherit settings from play,
  this might cause an error if settings environment on play depending on 'ansible_env'
  which was previouslly ignored

## 2.0 "Over the Hills and Far Away" - Jan 12, 2016

###Major Changes:

* Releases are now named after Led Zeppelin songs, 1.9 will be the last Van Halen named release.
* The new block/rescue/always directives allow for making task blocks and exception-like semantics
* New strategy plugins (e.g. `free`) allow control over the flow of task execution per play. The default (`linear`) will be the same as before.
* Improved error handling, with more detailed parser messages. General exception handling and display has been revamped.
* Task includes are now evaluated during execution, allowing more dynamic includes and options. Play includes are unchanged both still use the `include` directive.
* "with\_<lookup>" loops can now be used with task includes since they are dynamic.
* Callback, connection, cache and lookup plugin APIs have changed. Existing plugins might require modification to work with the new versions.
* Callbacks are now shipped in the active directory and don't need to be copied, just whitelisted in ansible.cfg.
* Many API changes. Those integrating directly with Ansible's API will encounter breaking changes, but the new API is much easier to use and test.
* Settings are now more inheritable; what you set at play, block or role will be automatically inherited by the contained tasks.
  This allows for new features to automatically be settable at all levels, previously we had to manually code this.
* Vars are now settable at play, block, role and task level with the `vars` directive and scoped to the tasks contained.
* Template code now retains types for bools and numbers instead of turning them into strings.
  If you need the old behaviour, quote the value and it will get passed around as a string
* Empty variables and variables set to null in yaml will no longer be converted to empty strings.  They will retain the value of `None`.
  To go back to the old behaviour, you can override the `null_representation` setting to an empty string in your config file or
  by setting the `ANSIBLE_NULL_REPRESENTATION` environment variable.
* Added `meta: refresh_inventory` to force rereading the inventory in a play.
  This re-executes inventory scripts, but does not force them to ignore any cache they might use.
* New delegate_facts directive, a boolean that allows you to apply facts to the delegated host (true/yes) instead of the inventory_hostname (no/false) which is the default and previous behaviour.
* local connections now work with 'su' as a privilege escalation method
* Ansible 2.0 has deprecated the “ssh” from ansible_ssh_user, ansible_ssh_host, and ansible_ssh_port to become ansible_user, ansible_host, and ansible_port.
* New ssh configuration variables (`ansible_ssh_common_args`, `ansible_ssh_extra_args`) can be used to configure a
  per-group or per-host ssh ProxyCommand or set any other ssh options.
  `ansible_ssh_extra_args` is used to set options that are accepted only by ssh (not sftp or scp, which have their own analogous settings).
* ansible-pull can now verify the code it runs when using git as a source repository, using git's code signing and verification features.
* Backslashes used when specifying parameters in jinja2 expressions in YAML dicts sometimes needed to be escaped twice.
  This has been fixed so that escaping once works. Here's an example of how playbooks need to be modified:

    ```
    # Syntax in 1.9.x
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ 'test1_junk 1\\\\3' | regex_replace('(.*)_junk (.*)', '\\\\1 \\\\2') }}"
    # Syntax in 2.0.x
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ 'test1_junk 1\\3' | regex_replace('(.*)_junk (.*)', '\\1 \\2') }}"

    # Output:
    "msg": "test1 1\\3"
    ```

* When a string with a trailing newline was specified in the playbook via yaml
dict format, the trailing newline was stripped. When specified in key=value
format the trailing newlines were kept. In v2, both methods of specifying the
string will keep the trailing newlines. If you relied on the trailing
newline being stripped you can change your playbook like this:

    ```
    # Syntax in 1.9.2
    vars:
      message: >
        Testing
        some things
    tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"

    # Syntax in 2.0.x
    vars:
      old_message: >
        Testing
        some things
      message: "{{ old_messsage[:-1] }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
    # Output
    "msg": "Testing some things"
    ```

* When specifying complex args as a variable, the variable must use the full jinja2
variable syntax ('{{var_name}}') - bare variable names there are no longer accepted.
In fact, even specifying args with variables has been deprecated, and will not be
allowed in future versions:

    ```
    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      gather_facts: false
      vars:
        my_dirs:
          - { path: /tmp/3a, state: directory, mode: 0755 }
          - { path: /tmp/3b, state: directory, mode: 0700 }
      tasks:
        - file:
          args: "{{item}}"
          with_items: my_dirs
    ```

###Plugins

* Rewritten dnf module that should be faster and less prone to encountering bugs in cornercases
* WinRM connection plugin passes all vars named `ansible_winrm_*` to the underlying pywinrm client. This allows, for instance, `ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore` to be used with newer versions of pywinrm to disable certificate validation on Python 2.7.9+.
* WinRM connection plugin put_file is significantly faster and no longer has file size limitations.

####Deprecated Modules (new ones in parens):

* ec2_ami_search (ec2_ami_find)
* quantum_network (os_network)
* glance_image

* skippy: same as default but does not display skip messages

###Minor changes:

* Many more tests. The new API makes things more testable and we took advantage of it.
* big_ip modules now support turning off ssl certificate validation (use only for self-signed certificates).
* Consolidated code from modules using urllib2 to normalize features, TLS and SNI support.
* synchronize module's dest_port parameter now takes precedence over the ansible_ssh_port inventory setting.
* Play output is now dynamically sized to terminal with a minimum of 80 coluumns (old default).
* vars_prompt and pause are now skipped with a warning if the play is called noninteractively (i.e. pull from cron).
* Support for OpenBSD's 'doas' privilege escalation method.
* Most vault operations can now be done over multilple files.
* ansible-vault encrypt/decrypt read from stdin if no other input file is given, and can write to a given ``--output file`` (including stdout, '-').
  This lets you avoid ever writing sensitive plaintext to disk.
* ansible-vault rekey accepts the --new-vault-password-file option.
* ansible-vault now preserves file permissions on edit and rekey and defaults to restrictive permissions for other options.
* Configuration items defined as paths (local only) now all support shell style interpolations.
* Many fixes and new options added to modules, too many to list here.
* Now you can see task file and line number when using verbosity of 3 or above.
* The ``[x-y]`` host range syntax is no longer supported. Note that ``[0:1]`` matches two hosts, i.e. the range is inclusive of its endpoints.
* We now recommend the use of `pattern1,pattern2` to combine host matching patterns.
  * The use of ':' as a separator conflicts with IPv6 addresses and host ranges. It will be deprecated in the future.
  * The undocumented use of ';' as a separator is now deprecated.
* modules and callbacks have been extended to support no_log to avoid data disclosure.
* new managed_syslog option has been added to control output to syslog on managed machines, no_log supersedes this settings.
* Lookup, vars and action plugin pathing has been normalized, all now follow the same sequence to find relative files.
* We do not ignore the explicitly set login user for ssh when it matches the 'current user' anymore, this allows overriding .ssh/config when it is set
  explicitly. Leaving it unset will still use the same user and respect .ssh/config. This also means ansible_ssh_user can now return a None value.
* environment variables passed to remote shells now default to 'controller' settings, with fallback to en_US.UTF8 which was the previous default.
* add_hosts is much stricter about host name and will prevent invalid names from being added.
* ansible-pull now defaults to doing shallow checkouts with git, use `--full` to return to previous behaviour.
* random cows are more random
* when: now gets the registered var after the first iteration, making it possible to break out of item loops
* Handling of undefined variables has changed.  In most places they will now raise an error instead of silently injecting an empty string.  Use the default filter if you want to approximate the old behaviour:

    ```
    - debug: msg="The error message was: {{error_code |default('') }}"
    ```

## 1.9.7 "Dancing in the Street" - TBD

* Fix for lxc_container backport which was broken because it tried to use a feature from ansible-2.x

  ansible's --diff option was used.
* Fix bug with non-english locales in git and apt modules
* Compatibility fix for using state=absent with the pip ansible module and pip-6.1.0+
* Backported support for ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation flag to disable cert validation on Python 2.7.9+ (and support for other passthru args to pywinrm transport).
* Backported various updates to user module (prevent accidental OS X group membership removals, various checkmode fixes).

## 1.9.4 "Dancing In the Street" - Oct 9, 2015

* Fixes a bug where yum state=latest would error if there were no updates to install.
* Fixes a bug where yum state=latest did not work with wildcard package names.
* Fixes a bug in lineinfile relating to escape sequences.
* Fixes a bug where vars_prompt was not keeping passwords private by default.

  messages coming out as empty strings.
* AES Keys generated for use in accelerated mode are now 256-bit by default instead of 128.
* Fix url fetching for SNI with python-2.7.9 or greater.  SNI does not work
  with python < 2.7.9.  The best workaround is probably to use the command
  module with curl or wget.
* Fix url fetching to allow tls-1.1 and tls-1.2 if the system's openssl library
  supports those protocols
* Fix ec2_ami_search module to check TLS Certificates

  * twilio
  * typetalk
* Fix docker module's parsing of docker-py version for dev checkouts
* Fix docker module to work with docker server api 1.19
* Change yum module's state=latest feature to update all packages specified in
  a single transaction.  This is the same type of fix as was made for yum's
  state=installed in 1.9.2 and both solves the same problems and with the same caveats.
* Fixed a bug where stdout from a module might be blank when there were were non-printable
  ASCII characters contained within it

## 1.9.2 "Dancing In the Street" - Jun 26, 2015

* Security fixes to check that hostnames match certificates with https urls (CVE-2015-3908)
  - get_url and uri modules
  - url and etcd lookup plugins
* Security fixes to the zone (Solaris containers), jail (bsd containers),
  and chroot connection plugins.  These plugins can be used to connect to
  their respective container types in leiu of the standard ssh connection.
  Prior to this fix being applied these connection plugins didn't properly
  handle symlinks within the containers which could lead to files intended to
  be written to or read from the container being written to or read from the
  host system instead. (CVE pending)

  - win_file.ps1
  - win_file.py
  - win_template.py
* Fix bug using with_sequence and a count that is zero.  Also allows counting backwards isntead of forwards

## 1.9 "Dancing In the Street" - Mar 25, 2015

Major changes:

* Added kerberos support to winrm connection plugin.
* Tags rehaul: added 'all', 'always', 'untagged' and 'tagged' special tags and normalized
  tag resolution. Added tag information to --list-tasks and new --list-tags option.
* Privilege Escalation generalization, new 'Become' system and variables  now will
  handle existing and new methods. Sudo and su have been kept for backwards compatibility.
  New methods pbrun and pfexec in 'alpha' state, planned adding 'runas' for winrm connection plugin.
* Improved ssh connection error reporting, now you get back the specific message from ssh.
* Added facility to document task module return values for registered vars, both for
  ansible-doc and the docsite. Documented copy, stats and acl modules, the rest must be
  updated individually (we will start doing so incrementally).
* Optimize the plugin loader to cache available plugins much more efficiently.
  For some use cases this can lead to dramatic improvements in startup time.
* Overhaul of the checksum system, now supports more systems and more cases more reliably and uniformly.
* Fix skipped tasks to not display their parameters if no_log is specified.
* Many fixes to unicode support, standarized functions to make it easier to add to input/output boundaries.
* Added travis integration to github for basic tests, this should speed up ticket triage and merging.
* environment: directive now can also be applied to play and is inhertited by tasks, which can still override it.
* expanded facts and OS/distribution support for existing facts and improved performance with pypy.
* new 'wantlist' option to lookups allows for selecting a list typed variable vs a comma delimited string as the return.
* the shared module code for file backups now uses a timestamp resolution of seconds (previouslly minutes).
* allow for empty inventories, this is now a warning and not an error (for those using localhost and cloud modules).
* sped up YAML parsing in ansible by up to 25% by switching to CParser loader.

New Modules:

* cryptab *-- manages linux encrypted block devices*
* gce_img *-- for utilizing GCE image resources*
* gluster_volume *-- manage glusterfs volumes*
* haproxy *-- for the load balancer of same name*
* known_hosts *-- manages the ssh known_hosts file*
* lxc_container *-- manage lxc containers*

* pkg5_publisher *-- manages Solaris pkg5 repository configuration*
* postgresql_ext *-- manage postgresql extensions*
* snmp_facts *-- gather facts via snmp*
* svc *-- manages daemontools based services*
* uptimerobot *-- manage monitoring with this service*

New Filters:

* ternary: allows for trueval/falseval assignment dependent on conditional
* cartesian: returns the Cartesian product of 2 lists
* to_uuid: given a string it will return an ansible domain specific UUID
* checksum: uses the ansible internal checksum to return a hash from a string
* hash: get a hash from a string (md5, sha1, etc)
* password_hash: get a hash form as string that can be used as a password in the user module (and others)
* A whole set of ip/network manipulation filters: ipaddr,ipwrap,ipv4,ipv6ipsubnet,nthhost,hwaddr,macaddr

Other Notable Changes:

* New lookup plugins:
  * dig: does dns resolution and returns IPs.
  * url: allows pulling data from a url.

* New callback plugins:
  * syslog_json: allows logging play output to a syslog network server using json format

* Many new enhancements to the amazon web service modules:
  * ec2 now applies all specified security groups when creating a new instance.  Previously it was only applying one
  * ec2_vol gained the ability to specify the EBS volume type
  * ec2_vol can now detach volumes by specifying instance=None
  * Fix ec2_group to purge specific grants rather than whole rules
  * Added tenancy support for the ec2 module
  * rds module has gained the ability to manage tags and set charset and public accessibility
  * ec2_snapshot module gained the capability to remove snapshots
  * Add alias support for route53
  * Add private_zones support to route53
  * ec2_asg: Add wait_for_instances parameter that waits until an instance is ready before ending the ansible task
* Many new docker improvements:
  * restart_policy parameters to configure when the container automatically restarts
  * If the docker client or server doesn't support an option, the task will now fail instead of silently ignoring the option
  * Add insecure_registry parameter for connecting to registries via http
  * New parameter to set a container's domain name
  * Undeprecated docker_image module until there's replacement functionality
  * Allow setting the container's pid namespace
  * Add a pull parameter that chooses when ansible will look for more recent images in the registry
  * docker module states have been greatly enhanced.  The reworked and new states are:
    * present now creates but does not start containers
    * restarted always restarts a container
    * reloaded restarts a container if ansible detects that the configuration is different than what is specified
      * reloaded accounts for exposed ports, env vars, and volumes
  * Can now connect to the docker server using TLS
* Several source control modules had force parameters that defaulted to true.
  These have been changed to default to false so as not to accidentally lose
  work.  Playbooks that depended on the former behaviour simply need to add
  force=True to the task that needs it.  Affected modules:
  * bzr: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the bzr module used to
    default to removing the modifications on any operation.  Now the module
    will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is specified.
    Operations that depend on a clean working tree may fail unless force=yes is
    added.
  * git: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the git module will now
    fail unless force is explicitly specified.  Specifying force=yes will allow
    the module to revert and overwrite local modifications to make git actions
    succeed.
  * hg: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the hg module used to
    default to removing the modifications on any operation.  Now the module
    will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is specified.
  * subversion: When updating a checkout with local modifications, you now need
    to add force=yes so the module will revert the modifications before updating.
* New inventory scripts:
  * vbox: virtualbox
  * consul: use consul as an inventory source
* gce gained the ip_forward parameter to forward ip packets
* disk_auto_delete parameter to gce that will remove the boot disk after an instance is destroyed
* gce can now spawn instances with no external ip
* gce_pd gained the ability to choose a disk type
* gce_net gained target_tags parameter for creating firewall rules
* rax module has new parameters for making use of a boot volume
* Add scheduler_hints to the nova_compute module for optional parameters
* vsphere_guest now supports deploying guests from a template
* Many fixes for hardlink and softlink handling in file-related modules
* Implement user, group, mode, and selinux parameters for the unarchive module
* authorized_keys can now use url as a key source
* authorized_keys has a new exclusive parameter that determines if keys that weren't specified in the task
* The selinux module now sets the current running state to permissive if state='disabled'
* Can now set accounts to expire via the user module
* Overhaul of the service module to make code simpler and behave better for systems running several popular init systems
* yum module now has a parameter to refresh its cache of package metadata
* apt module gained a build_dep parameter to install a package's build dependencies
* Add parameters to the postgres modules to specify a unix socket to connect to the db
* The mount module now supports bind mounts
* Add a clone parameter to git module that allows you to get information about a remote repo even if it doesn't exist locally.
* Add a refspec argument to the git module that allows pulling commits that aren't part of a branch
* Many documentation additions and fixes.

* no_log parameter now surpressess data from callbacks/output as well as syslog
* ansible-galaxy install -f requirements.yml allows advanced options and installs from non-galaxy SCM sources and tarballs.
* command_warnings feature will warn about when usage of the shell/command module can be simplified to use core modules - this can be enabled in ansible.cfg
* new omit value can be used to leave off a parameter when not set, like so module_name: a=1 b={{ c | default(omit) }}, would not pass value for b (not even an empty value) if c was not set.
* developers: 'baby JSON' in module responses, originally intended for writing modules in bash, is removed as a feature to simplify logic, script module remains available for running bash scripts.
* async jobs started in "fire & forget" mode can now be checked on at a later time.
* added ability to subcategorize modules for docs.ansible.com
* added ability for shipped modules to have aliases with symlinks
* added ability to deprecate older modules by starting with "_" and including "deprecated: message why" in module docs

New Modules:

- cloud
  * rax_cdb *-- manages Rackspace Cloud Database instances*
  * rax_cdb_database *-- manages Rackspace Cloud Databases*
  * rax_cdb_user *-- manages Rackspace Cloud Database users*
- monitoring
  * bigpanda *-- support for bigpanda*
  * zabbix_maintaince *-- handles outage windows with Zabbix*
- net_infrastructure
  * a10_server *-- manages server objects on A10 devices*
  * a10_service_group *-- manages service group objects on A10 devices*
  * a10_virtual_server *-- manages virtual server objects on A10 devices*
- system
  * getent  *-- read getent databases*

Some other notable changes:

* added the ability to set "instance filters" in the ec2.ini to limit results from the inventory plugin.
* upgrades for various variable precedence items and parsing related items
* added a new "follow" parameter to the file and copy modules, which allows actions to be taken on the target of a symlink rather than the symlink itself.
* if a module should ever traceback, it will return a standard error, catchable by ignore_errors, versus an 'unreachable'
* ec2_lc: added support for multiple new parameters like kernel_id, ramdisk_id and ebs_optimized.
* ec2_elb_lb: added support for the connection_draining_timeout and cross_az_load_balancing options.

* ec2_ami_search: support for SSD and IOPS provisioned EBS images
* can set ansible_sudo_exe as an inventory variable which allows specifying
  a different sudo (or equivalent) command
* git module: Submodule handling has changed.  Previously if you used the
  ``recursive`` parameter to handle submodules, ansible would track the
  submodule upstream's head revision.  This has been changed to checkout the
  version of the submodule specified in the superproject's git repository.
  This is inline with what git submodule update does.  If you want the old
  behaviour use the new module parameter track_submodules=yes
* Checksumming of transferred files has been made more portable and now uses
  the sha1 algorithm instead of md5 to be compatible with FIPS-140.
  - As a small side effect, the fetch module no longer returns a useful value
    in remote_md5.  If you need a replacement, switch to using remote_checksum
    which returns the sha1sum of the remote file.
* ansible-doc CLI tool contains various improvements for working with different terminals

And various other bug fixes and improvements ...

* enabled error_on_undefined_vars by default, which will make errors in playbooks more obvious
* role dependencies -- one role can now pull in another, with parameters of its own.
* added the ability to have tasks execute even during a check run (always_run).
* added the ability to set the maximum failure percentage for a group of hosts.

## 1.2.3 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- Aug 21, 2013

* Local security fixes for predictable file locations for ControlPersist and retry file paths on shared machines
on operating systems without kernel symlink/hardlink protections.

## 1.2.2 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- July 4, 2013

* Added a configuration file option [paramiko_connection] record_host_keys which allows the code that paramiko uses
to update known_hosts to be disabled.  This is done because paramiko can be very slow at doing this if you have a
large number of hosts and some folks may not want this behavior.  This can be toggled independently of host key checking
and does not affect the ssh transport plugin.  Use of the ssh transport plugin is preferred if you have ControlPersist
capability, and Ansible by default in 1.2.1 and later will autodetect.

## 1.2.1 "Hear About It Later" -- July 4, 2013

* Connection default is now "smart", which discovers if the system openssh can support ControlPersist, and uses
  it if so, if not falls back to paramiko.
* Host key checking is on by default.  Disable it if you like by adding host_key_checking=False in the [default]
  section of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/ansible.cfg or by exporting ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
* Paramiko now records host keys it was in contact with host key checking is on.  It is somewhat sluggish when doing this,
  so switch to the 'ssh' transport if this concerns you.

## 1.2 "Right Now" -- June 10, 2013

Core Features:

* capability to set 'all_errors_fatal: True' in a playbook to force any error to stop execution versus
  a whole group or serial block needing to fail
  usable, without breaking the ability to override in ansible
* ability to use variables from {{ }} syntax in mainline playbooks, new 'when' conditional, as detailed
  in documentation.  Can disable old style replacements in ansible.cfg if so desired, but are still active
  by default.
* can set ansible_ssh_private_key_file as an inventory variable (similar to ansible_ssh_host, etc)
* 'when' statement can be affixed to task includes to auto-affix the conditional to each task therein
* cosmetic: "*****" banners in ansible-playbook output are now constant width
* --limit can now be given a filename (--limit @filename) to constrain a run to a host list on disk
* failed playbook runs will create a retry file in /var/tmp/ansible usable with --limit
* roles allow easy arrangement of reusable tasks/handlers/files/templates
* pre_tasks and post_tasks allow for separating tasks into blocks where handlers will fire around them automatically
* "meta: flush_handler" task capability added for when you really need to force handlers to run
* new --start-at-task option to ansible playbook allows starting at a specific task name in a long playbook
* added a log file for ansible/ansible-playbook, set 'log_path' in the configuration file or ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH in environment
* debug mode always outputs debug in playbooks, without needing to specify -v
* external inventory script added for Spacewalk / Red Hat Satellite servers
* It is now possible to feed JSON structures to --extra-vars.  Pass in a JSON dictionary/hash to feed in complex data.
* group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories can now be kept alongside the playbook as well as inventory (or both!)
* more filters: ability to say {{ foo|success }} and {{ foo|failed }} and when: foo|success and when: foo|failed
* more filters: {{ path|basename }} and {{ path|dirname }}
* lookup plugins now use the basedir of the file they have included from, avoiding needs of ../../../ in places and
increasing the ease at which things can be reorganized.
