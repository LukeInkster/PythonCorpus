This is a test of various filter plugins found in Ansible (ex: core.py), and 
not so much a test of the core filters in Jinja2.

Dumping the same structure to YAML

{{ some_structure | to_nice_yaml }}

Dumping the same structure to JSON, but don't pretty print

{{ some_structure | to_json }}

Dumping the same structure to YAML, but don't pretty print

{{ some_structure | to_yaml }}

From a recorded task, the changed, failed, success, and skipped
filters are shortcuts to ask if those tasks produced changes, failed,
succeeded, or skipped (as one might guess).

Changed = {{ some_registered_var | changed }}
Failed  = {{ some_registered_var | failed }}
Success = {{ some_registered_var | success }}
Skipped = {{ some_registered_var | skipped }}

The mandatory filter fails if a variable is not defined and returns the value.
To avoid breaking this test, this variable is already defined.

a = {{ a | mandatory }}

There are various casts available

int = {{ a | int }}
bool = {{ 1 | bool }}

String quoting

quoted = {{ 'quoted' | quote }}

The fileglob module returns the list of things matching a pattern.

fileglob = {{ (output_dir + '/*') | fileglob }}

There are also various string operations that work on paths.  These do not require
files to exist and are passthrus to the python os.path functions

/etc/motd with basename = {{ '/etc/motd' | basename }}
/etc/motd with dirname  = {{ '/etc/motd' | dirname }}

TODO: realpath follows symlinks.  There isn't a test for this just now.

TODO: add tests for set theory operations like union

TODO: add tests for regex, match, and search
