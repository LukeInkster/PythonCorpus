#
# Script to be used with vault_password_file or --vault-password-file
# to retrieve the vault password via your OSes native keyring application
#
# This script requires the ``keyring`` python module
#
# Add a [vault] section to your ansible.cfg file,
# the only option is 'username'. Example:
#
# [vault]
# username = 'ansible_vault'
#
# Additionally, it would be a good idea to configure vault_password_file in
# ansible.cfg
#
# [defaults]
# ...
# vault_password_file = /path/to/vault-keyring.py
# ...
#
# To set your password: python /path/to/vault-keyring.py set
#
# If you choose to not configure the path to vault_password_file in ansible.cfg
# your ansible-playbook command may look like:
#
# ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=/path/to/vault-keyring.py site.yml
