NAME
----
ansible-galaxy - manage roles using galaxy.ansible.com


SYNOPSIS
--------
ansible-galaxy [delete|import|info|init|install|list|login|remove|search|setup] [--help] [options] ...


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Ansible Galaxy* is a shared repository for Ansible roles.
The ansible-galaxy command can be used to manage these roles,
or for creating a skeleton framework for roles you'd like to upload to Galaxy.

COMMON OPTIONS
--------------

*-h*, *--help*::

Show a help message related to the given sub-command.

INSTALL
-------

The *install* sub-command is used to install roles.

USAGE
~~~~~

$ ansible-galaxy install [options] [-r FILE | role_name(s)[,version] | tar_file(s)]

Roles can be installed in several different ways:

* A username.rolename[,version] - this will install a single role. The Galaxy
  API will be contacted to provide the information about the role, and the
  corresponding .tar.gz will be downloaded from *github.com*. If the version
  is omitted, the most recent version available will be installed.

* A file name, using *-r* - this will install multiple roles listed one per
  line. The format of each line is the same as above: username.rolename[,version]

* A .tar.gz of a valid role you've downloaded directly from *github.com*. This
  is mainly useful when the system running Ansible does not have access to
  the Galaxy API, for instance when behind a firewall or proxy.

configured in your *ansible.cfg* file (/etc/ansible/roles if not configured)

*-r* 'ROLE_FILE', *--role-file=*'ROLE_FILE'::

A file containing a list of roles to be imported, as specified above. This

LOGIN

The *login* sub-command is used to authenticate with galaxy.ansible.com.

It will authenticate the user, retrieve a token from Galaxy, and store it
in the user's home directory.

USAGE
~~~~~

$ ansible-galaxy login [options]

The *login* sub-command prompts for a *GitHub* username and password. It does
NOT send your password to Galaxy. It actually authenticates with GitHub and
creates a personal access token. It then sends the personal access token to
Galaxy, which in turn verifies that you are you and returns a Galaxy access
token. After authentication completes the *GitHub* personal access token is
destroyed. 

If you do not wish to use your GitHub password, or if you have two-factor
authentication enabled with GitHub, use the *--github-token* option to pass a
personal access token that you create. Log into GitHub, go to Settings and
click on Personal Access Token to create a token.
