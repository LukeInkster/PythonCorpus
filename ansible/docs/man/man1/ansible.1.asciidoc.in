OPTIONS
-------

*-a* \'_ARGUMENTS_', *--args=*\'_ARGUMENTS_'::

this does not imply prompting for passwords.

*K*, *--ask-become-pass*::

Use this 'USERNAME' to login to the target host, instead of the current user.

*--vault-password-file=*'VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE'::

A file containing the vault password to be used during the decryption of vault encrypted files.

Verbose mode, more output from successful actions will be shown.

INVENTORY
---------

Ansible stores the hosts it can potentially operate on in an inventory.
This can be an ini-like file, a script, directory or a list.
The ini syntax is one host per line.  Groups headers are allowed and
are included on their own line, enclosed in square brackets that start the line.

Ranges of hosts are also supported.  For more information and
additional options, see the documentation on http://docs.ansible.com/.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

The following environment variables may be specified.

ANSIBLE_INVENTORY  -- Override the default ansible inventory file

ANSIBLE_LIBRARY -- Override the default ansible module library path

ANSIBLE_CONFIG -- Override the default ansible config file

Many more are available for most options in ansible.cfg


FILES
-----

/etc/ansible/hosts -- Default inventory file

/usr/share/ansible/ -- Default module library

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg -- Config file, used if present

~/.ansible.cfg -- User config file, overrides the default config if present
