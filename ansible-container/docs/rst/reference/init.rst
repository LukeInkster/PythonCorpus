.. command::ansible-playbook init

The ``ansible-container init`` command initializes your project for use with
Ansible Container.

If you have a project you would like to build, run, and deploy with Ansible Container,
this command bootstraps your project with some boilerplate files in the
``ansible/`` directory. The :doc:`/tour` document outlines the files created. You
should modify as based on your individual needs.
