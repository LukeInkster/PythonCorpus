Twilio Example
===========================

![gordon](https://gordon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/twilio.svg)

This project defines one API Gateway called ``twilioexample``and connects one
lambda written in python called ``helloworld`` with the ``/`` url.

This Lambda returns one super-simple ``TwiML`` response that will make your twilio phone
number reply to any call saying ``Hello, this is Twilio powered by Gordon!``.

Once you have deployed this project, you'll need to configure your phone number:
* Go to [Twilio: Manage Phone Numbers](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/)
* Click on the number you want to configure, and in the ``A CALL COMES IN`` select ``Webhook`` and add as value the url of your API Gateway.
* Save the changes and call your number!

As you can see this APIGateway example is quite complex because we need to do several things
in order to make the integration work:

1. Twilio sends requests with content type ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` To enable API gateway to parse them we need to passthrough that content-type.
2. By default lambda will try to render the response as JSON which will break TwiML. To override it we need to create a new integration response mapping.
3. Lastly we need to make the response be XML instead of JSON.
