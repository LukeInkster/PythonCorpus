HTTP Prompt
===========

|PyPI| |Travis| |Appveyor| |Coverage|

HTTP Prompt is an interactive command-line HTTP client featuring autocomplete
and syntax highlighting, built on HTTPie_ and prompt_toolkit_.

Installation
------------

Just install it like a regular Python package::

    $ pip install http-prompt

You'll probably see some permission errors if you're trying to install it on
the system-wide Python. It isn't recommended. But if that's what you want to
do, you need to ``sudo``::

    $ sudo pip install http-prompt

Another alternative is to use ``--user`` option to install the package into
your user directory::

    $ pip install --user http-prompt

To upgrade HTTP Prompt, do::

    $ pip install -U http-prompt


Quickstart
----------

To start a session, you use the ``http-prompt`` executable:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start with the given URL
    $ http-prompt http://httpbin.org

    # Or start with some initial options
    $ http-prompt localhost:8000/api --auth user:pass username=somebody

Once you're in a session, you can use the following commands.

To change URL address, use ``cd``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Relative URL path
    > cd api/v1

    # Absolute URL
    > cd http://localhost/api

To add headers, querystring, or body parameters, use the syntax as in HTTPie_.
The following are all valid:

.. code-block:: bash

    > Content-Type:application/json username=john
    > 'name=John Doe' apikey==abc
    > Authorization:"Bearer auth_token"

You can also add HTTPie_ options like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    > --form --auth user:pass
    > --verify=no username=jane

To preview how HTTP Prompt is going to call HTTPie_, do:

.. code-block:: bash

    > httpie post
    http --auth user:pass --form POST http://localhost/api apikey==abc username=john

You can temporarily override the request parameters by supplying options and
parameters in ``httpie`` command. The overrides won't affect the later
requests.

.. code-block:: bash

    # No parameters initially
    > httpie
    http http://localhost

    # Override parameters temporarily
    > httpie /api/something page==2 --json
    http --json http://localhost/api/something page==2

    # Current state is not affected by the above overrides
    > httpie
    http http://localhost

To actually send a request, enter one of the HTTP methods:

.. code-block:: bash

    > get
    > post
    > put
    > patch
    > delete
    > head

The above HTTP methods also support temporary overriding:

.. code-block:: bash

    # No parameters initially
    > httpie
    http http://localhost

    # Send a request with some overrided parameters
    > post /api/v1 --form name=jane

    # Current state remains intact
    > httpie
    http http://localhost

To remove an existing header, a querystring parameter, a body parameter, or an
HTTPie_ option:

.. code-block:: bash

    > rm -h Content-Type
    > rm -q apikey
    > rm -b username
    > rm -o --auth

To reset the session, i.e., clear all parameters and options:

.. code-block:: bash

    > rm *

To exit a session, simply enter:

.. code-block:: bash

    > exit


Configuration
-------------

When launched for the first time, HTTP Prompt creates a user config file.
The config file is ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/http-prompt/config.py`` (or
``%LOCALAPPDATA%/http-prompt/config.py`` on Windows), By default, it's
``~/.config/http-prompt/config.py`` (or ``~/AppData/Local/http-prompt/config.py``).

``config.py`` is a Python module with all the available options you can
customize. Don't worry. You don't need to know Python to edit it. Just open it
up with a text editor and follow the guidance inside.


Persistent Context
------------------

HTTP Prompt keeps a data structure called *Context* to represent your current
session. Every time you enter a command, HTTP Prompt saves the context to your
filesystem, enabling you to resume your previous session when you restart
``http-prompt``.

Categorized by hostnames and ports, context data is stored in the user data
directory, which is ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/http-prompt`` (or ``%LOCALAPPDATA%/http-prompt``
on Windows). By default, it's ``~/.local/share/http-prompt`` (or
``~/AppData/Local/http-prompt`` on Windows).

As context data may contain sensitive data like API keys, you should keep the
user data directory private. By default, HTTP Prompt sets the modes of
``$XDG_DATA_HOME/http-prompt`` to ``rwx------`` (i.e., ``700``) so that the
only person who can read it is the owner (you).


Roadmap
-------

* More configurable options
* More HTTP headers for autocomplete
* Support for advanced HTTPie syntax, e.g, ``field:=json`` and ``field=@file.json``
* Support for cURL command preview
* Shell command evaluation
* Python syntax evaluation
* HTTP/2 support
