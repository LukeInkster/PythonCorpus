The project mailing list

If you encounter a bug with ``scikit-learn`` or something that needs
clarification in the docstring or the online documentation, please feel free to
ask on the `Mailing List <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/support.html>`_


Q&A communities with Machine Learning practitioners
----------------------------------------------------

  :Metaoptimize/QA:

    A forum for Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and
    other Data Analytics discussions (similar to what Stackoverflow
    is for developers): http://metaoptimize.com/qa

    A good starting point is the discussion on `good freely available
    textbooks on machine learning`_

  :Quora.com:

    Quora has a topic for Machine Learning related questions that
    also features some interesting discussions:
    https://www.quora.com/topic/Machine-Learning

    Have a look at the best questions section, eg: `What are some
    good resources for learning about machine learning`_.
