# Environments

The gym comes prepackaged with many many environments. It's this common api around many environments that makes the gym so great. Here we will list additional environments that do not come prepacked with the gym. Submit another to this list via a pull-request. 

_**NOTICE**: Its possible that in time OpenAI will develop a full fledged repository of suplimental environments. Until this this bit of markdown will suffice._
