Tutorial
========

You want to develop an application with Python and Flask?  Here you have
the chance to learn by example.  In this tutorial, we will create a simple
microblogging application.  It only supports one user that can create
text-only entries and there are no feeds or comments, but it still
features everything you need to get started.  We will use Flask and SQLite
as a database (which comes out of the box with Python) so there is nothing
else you need.

If you want the full source code in advance or for comparison, check out
