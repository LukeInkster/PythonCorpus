Deployment Options
==================

While lightweight and easy to use, **Flask's built-in server is not suitable
for production** as it doesn't scale well and by default serves only one
request at a time.  Some of the options available for properly running Flask in
production are documented here.

If you want to deploy your Flask application to a WSGI server not listed here,
look up the server documentation about how to use a WSGI app with it.  Just
remember that your :class:`Flask` application object is the actual WSGI
application.
